# Prediction API

FastAPI service that loads the repository's `model.pkl` artifact and exposes
`/health`, `/options`, and `/predict` endpoints. The model was serialized with
scikit-learn 1.9.1, so that version is pinned in `requirements.txt`.

Run it from this directory after installing the requirements:

```sh
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Interactive API docs are available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
